# Backspace String Compare
Problem [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/description/): https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/description/  
Difficulty: easy  
File submitted: submitted_code.go

### Notes
- /main/main.go: a main package written to make sure functions from backspaceCompare package are exported and callable.
- /backspaceCompare: contains actual solution and testing program.
- submitted_code.go: the actual code that I submitted on Leetcode. The only differences between this file and /backspaceCompare.backspaceCompare.go are the package statement at the top and slightly modified function name (lowercase b instead of uppercase B in backspaceCompare function name).
